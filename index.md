## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document is meant to provide guidance and clarity in the creation of inclusive descriptions for archival materials in finding aids and digital collections metadata.  It was created by the Reparative Description Working Group to better align the inclusive and reparative description efforts across the CSUN University Library.  The guidelines were influenced by many other works on inclusive and reparative description which are cited in footnotes throughout.  See the Bibliography on page [x] for a full list of resources consulted.  Finally, this work aligns with the University’s values and the Roadmap to the Future’s strategic directions to Disrupt Systemic Inequities, Enhance Community Connections, and Honor Our History and Aspire to a More Equitable Future. 

Many of our past description and collecting practices have privileged a predominantly white, western historical narrative.  With these guidelines, we aim to address and mitigate past and future harm by providing a framework for inclusive resource description.  We also hold ourselves accountable for our past practices by preserving copies of legacy description and/or documenting changes made through a changelog or tracking software, as well as documenting the rationale behind any significant changes. See sections 3 and 4 for specific guidance for preserving legacy archival and digital collections description, respectively. 

These guidelines are expected to evolve over time as standards, terminology, and culture changes and progresses. We are committed to reviewing the guidelines annually and revising it as needed, and as we receive feedback.
