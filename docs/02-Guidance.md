### Creator-sourced/transcribed description

When transcribing directly from a source, indicate this in the record and provide context, if needed. According to the *Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia’s Anti-Racist Description Resources*,

> Consider your audience and the potential for harm when making decisions about whether to preserve problematic creator-supplied language. In most cases, preserve but contextualize creator-sourced original description when racism is an important context for understanding records. If you choose to maintain some or all racist creator-based description, draw a distinction between the creator-supplied description and archivist-supplied description…[^1]

While they speak specifically to racist content, this guidance is useful when working with any challenging creator-sourced content.

**Example:**

![Letter to Wendell Miller](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/WLM_01-44_03.jpg)

This letter published in the CSU Japanese American Digitization Project from the Reverend Wendell L. Miller Collection was originally described as:

> An angry letter sent to Mr. Wendell L. Miller.

It was updated to include a transcription of the letter itself as well as some contextual information:

> A letter sent to Reverend Wendell Miller that reads “If you are a Jap sympathizer we do not need you or your kind.” The sender’s name is illegible. “Jap” is a racist epithet that was used against Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Miller and other members of his church assisted Japanese Americans en route to various internment camps.

### Content warnings and disclaimers

If content in a collection or resource might be deemed offensive or upsetting in some way - whether racist, ableist, sexist, homophobic, etc. - consider providing a warning or disclaimer for users. This type of material may be found in a variety of formats such as outdated language in documents or graphic imagery in print or moving image collections. The intent with these warnings is to make users aware of the presence of material that may be disturbing. When drafting a warning, be specific about the nature of the content so that users are able to make an informed decision about accessing the materials.

**Example:**

The [World War I Narratives](https://digital-library.csun.edu/ww1-narratives) digital collection includes digitized materials from three archival collections that highlight the experiences of American soldiers during that time. Some of the materials include graphic content depicting partial nudity and corporal punishment. Previously, the collection-level description simply noted “Warning: This collection contains graphic images.” It was edited for more specifity and now reads, “Warning: This collection contains graphic images depicting partial nudity and corporal punishment.” Additionally, a note in the Title of item records with graphic content  includes a warning (e.g.  “[Warning: Partial nudity] Two indigenous women washing clothes, ca. 1910”)

Defining or identifying challenging content involves a lot of subjective judgment. If you are unsure whether to implement a warning, try to get a second or third opinion. Consult with colleagues or bring it to the Reparative Description Working Group. When possible, try to provide historical context for the resource.

See Section 3 for specific guidance on content warnings for archival collections and Section 4 for digital collections.

### Community consultation and access

How we describe materials must support the information-seeking needs of communities being represented and/or described, not just students or academic scholars. It is also important to consider these communities as equal stakeholders in resource and collection description.[^2] Identifying, making contact, and building trust with communities takes time and planning. Although it may not always be possible to identify and collaborate with them on metadata, it is important to try to build time and resources to do this during the planning phase of a project and to compensate community members for their time, labor, and expertise. 

There are various models that can be used to collaborate with communities, but here are some general tips:
