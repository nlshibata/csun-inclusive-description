### Creator-sourced/transcribed description

When transcribing directly from a source, indicate this in the record and provide context, if needed. According to the *Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia’s Anti-Racist Description Resources*,

> Consider your audience and the potential for harm when making decisions about whether to preserve problematic creator-supplied language. In most cases, preserve but contextualize creator-sourced original description when racism is an important context for understanding records. If you choose to maintain some or all racist creator-based description, draw a distinction between the creator-supplied description and archivist-supplied description…[^1]

While they speak specifically to racist content, this guidance is useful when working with any challenging creator-sourced content.

**Example:**

![Letter to Wendell Miller](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/WLM_01-44_03.jpg)

This letter published in the CSU Japanese American Digitization Project from the Reverend Wendell L. Miller Collection was originally described as:

> An angry letter sent to Mr. Wendell L. Miller.

It was updated to include a transcription of the letter itself as well as some contextual information:

> A letter sent to Reverend Wendell Miller that reads “If you are a Jap sympathizer we do not need you or your kind.” The sender’s name is illegible. “Jap” is a racist epithet that was used against Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Miller and other members of his church assisted Japanese Americans en route to various internment camps.

### Content warnings and disclaimers

If content in a collection or resource might be deemed offensive or upsetting in some way - whether racist, ableist, sexist, homophobic, etc. - consider providing a warning or disclaimer for users and be mindful of where you place it to get their attention prior to viewing materials. This type of material may be found in a variety of formats such as outdated language in documents or graphic imagery in print or moving image collections.  The intent with these warnings is to make users aware of the presence of material that may be disturbing. When drafting a warning, be specific about the nature of the content so that users are able to make an informed decision about accessing the materials. 

**Example:**

The [World War I Narratives](https://digital-library.csun.edu/ww1-narratives) digital collection includes digitized materials from three archival collections that highlight the experiences of American soldiers during that time. Some of the materials include graphic content depicting partial nudity and corporal punishment. Previously, the collection-level description simply noted “Warning: This collection contains graphic images.” It was edited for more specifity and now reads, “Warning: This collection contains graphic images depicting partial nudity and corporal punishment.” Additionally, a note in the Title of item records with graphic content  includes a warning (e.g.  “[Warning: Partial nudity] Two indigenous women washing clothes, ca. 1910”)

Defining or identifying challenging content involves a lot of subjective judgment. If you are unsure whether to implement a warning, try to get a second or third opinion. Consult with colleagues or bring it to the Reparative Description Working Group. When possible, try to provide historical context for the resource.

See [Section 3](/csun-inclusive-description/docs/03-Archival-Description) for specific guidance on content warnings for archival collections and [Section 4](/csun-inclusive-description/docs/04-Digital-Collections) for digital collections.

### Community consultation and access

How we describe materials must support the information-seeking needs of communities being represented and/or described, not just students or academic scholars. It is also important to consider these communities as equal stakeholders in resource and collection description.[^2] Identifying, making contact, and building trust with communities takes time and planning. Although it may not always be possible to identify and collaborate with them on metadata, it is important to try to build time and resources to do this during the planning phase of a project and to compensate community members for their time, labor, and expertise. 

There are various models that can be used to collaborate with communities, but here are some general tips:

- Keep in mind that communities are not monolithic.  
- Consider the positionality of your community source. 
- Budget time to communicate with and develop a relationship with the community, in order to avoid being extractive. 
- Be prepared to explain (with minimal jargon) what the work is that we do, and why we do it. 
- Listen. Let the community be the authority. Providing a space within a large, academic institution for community voices to be heard can be as important as their consultation on our specific description questions.

### Voice and style

Regarding voice and style, we follow the recommendations produced by the A4BLiP: 

- decenter “neutrality” and “objectivity” in favor of “respect” and “care”; 
- avoid passive voice when describing oppressive relationships; 
- use active voice in order to embed responsibility within description; 
- focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies; 
- refrain from writing flowery, valorizing biographical notes for collection creators; 
- use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, and hate mail when they are appropriate; 
- describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.[^3]

### Controlled vocabularies

LCSH is the vocabulary we have used most consistently across the Library’s collections because of its comprehensiveness and interoperability across systems.  Proposals to add or revise subject headings go through a lengthy review process and final decisions historically lean conservative, often in favor of making minor edits or keeping older, outdated terminology.   

Catalogers may opt to submit a [heading change proposal to the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/lcsh-process.html).   

Using [alternative vocabularies or thesauri](/csun-inclusive-description/docs/01-Appendix) is a valid option when a LCSH term is deemed outdated or harmful, but implementation is specific to each system.  For instance, controlled vocabularies for bibliographic materials are governed at the systemwide level by the ULMS. Consult your local system guidelines for instructions on applying non-LCSH subjects. 

### Gender and sexual identities

It is important that we use terms referring to gender and sexual identity that are respectful to those represented in our resources.  Ideally, they should align with how the individuals described self-identify.  If they do not explicitly disclose their preferred terms, be transparent about this in your description.

**Example:**

![Finding aid screenshot from Virginia Prince Papers](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/Virginia-Prince-papers.jpg)

Apply the pronouns that the individual being described uses themselves.  If it is unclear what pronoun they identify with, try to avoid pronouns and instead use the individual’s name or a non-gendered descriptor (e.g., the person in the photograph, the musician, etc.).[^4]

Avoid using deadnames whenever possible. Deadnames refer to the birth name or old name of a transgender or non-binary person.  It misgenders its subject and consequently dismisses their gender identity, potentially outing them as transgender.  If a person goes by multiple names over their lifetime, use their preferred name.  If no preferred name is indicated, use your best judgement and consider adding a public note regarding the existence of multiple names for context. 

**Example:**

![LCNAF screenshot for Ari Kane](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/LCNAF-example.jpg)

The Ariadne Kane Outreach Institute for Gender Studies Collection finding aid initially used the LCNAF version of her name, deadnaming her. In 2025 the finding aid was revised to remove her deadname and instead reference [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) as the authority record. 

![Wikidata screenshot for Ari Kane](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/Wikidata-example.jpg)

To make these resources discoverable to our users, assign subject headings and name authorities from approved controlled vocabularies.   

For subject headings, LCSH is what we use most consistently across our library systems at CSUN. However, it doesn’t often provide the level of specificity needed to describe LGBTQ+ individuals and communities.  When this is the case, consider adding additional terminology from alternative thesauri such as [Homosaurus](https://homosaurus.org/), while retaining the LCSH term(s).  

Similarly, while we typically consult LCNAF first for name authorities, you should consult an alternative resource if LCNAF deadnames an individual or otherwise does not provide an accurate and/or respectful authority record.  As in the Ariadne Kane example above, WikiData can be a good alternative to LCNAF. See [Appendix I](/csun-inclusive-description/docs/01-Appendix) for other resources.

### Women's names

Before the 1970s, married women were often referred to by their husband’s name with the honorific “Mrs.” (e.g. Mrs. John Doe).  This effectively erases women’s individual identities and significantly inhibits discovery by conflating them with their husbands.  When describing materials where a woman is identified solely by her husband’s name, do your best to find their full name and include it in the record.  Ideally, this should include their first name, maiden surname, and married surname.[^5] [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/en/united-states/), which is operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a free genealogical database that can be used to search vital records to find this information.  Please note that you must create an account in order to use it. 

**Example:**

![Screenshot of scrapbook officer list](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/CPWC03.jpg)

A page from the 1914 Owensmouth Women’s Club scrapbook lists its officers by their husbands’ names.  In the digital collections item record, we uncovered their full names and birth and death dates and included those in the descriptive metadata: 

>...list of officers elected: Mrs. L.C. Kimball Jr (Irene Stanley Kimball, 1879-1950); Mrs. John Haas (Katie May Ijams Haas, 1877-1968); Mrs. T.A. Hull (Mary Adelaid Wood Hull, 1860-1942); Mrs. Fred Balster (Philomena Balster Brubaker, 1877-1964); Mrs. Helen Mitchel (Helen C. Mitchell), Mrs. L.M. (G.W.) Burch (Lillian May Woodward Burch, 1867-1960).

### Age and ageism

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “ageism refers to the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age.”[^6] Terms such as “seniors,” “elderly,” and “aged,” reinforce negative stereotypes about aging. Instead of identifying people by their age, use language that is people first.

**Example:**

![Photograph from the Farmworker Movement Digital Collection](https://nlshibata.github.io/csun-inclusive-description/images/17.41.JK.N35.B15.01.06.32.jpg)

The original title for this photograph in the Farmworker Movement Digital Collection “Children standing around an old woman holding a cane during the march to Sacramento, 1966” was changed to “Unidentified woman and two children sit on a bench during the march to Sacramento, 1966.” 

When identifying by age is necessary, use more neutral phrases like “older adult, “older person,” or “persons over 65.”   

### Race and ethnicity

When describing materials, it is important to give voice to those that have been historically left out of our description.  The following definitions, taken from the D.C. Office of Human Rights and Office of Racial Equity, are helpful in understanding the language used to describe race and ethnicity:

>**Race** is often defined as a social classification or association based on a person’s ancestry, ethnicity, and perceived inherited physical characteristics (hair, skin color, etc.) (ex. White, Black, Asian, etc.).
>
>**National origin** is the state, country, or nation from which a person or their ancestors were born. (ex. A person born in Venezuela is Venezuelan).
>
>**Ethnicity** is a social construct that defines a set of people by their shared common cultures and traditions, including by not limited to race, nationality, or religion. (ex. Jewish, Japanese, Creole)[^7]

#### Spelling and capitalization

- Terms describing racial and ethnic groups are capitalized (e.g. Guatemalan, Vietnamese American).  
- Capitalize Black when referring to race and ethnicity, but not white.  
  - While some style guides and institutions capitalize white because it is a proper noun in this context, many do not. The Associated Press, for instance, chooses not to because “white people generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color.” The New York Times adds that they do not capitalize white in part because it “has long been capitalized by hate groups.”[^8]
- Do not hyphenate multi word terms.  For instance, write African American, not African-American. 

#### Terminology

In general, identify people and communities using racial and/or ethnic terms that they use to describe themselves.  

In the past, people used terms now considered outdated or harmful. Until the mid-20th century, for instance, the terms “negro” and “colored” were widely used by African Americans and in respected publications and organizations by African Americans, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Council of Negro Women.[^9]  Legacy names and terms like these should be contextualized according to the system specific guidelines in Sections 3 and 4.   

Be sure that the terms you use are as clear and specific as possible. For example, instead of describing an individual as Asian American or Hispanic American, use more specific labels that identify their nation or region of origin, such as Korean American or Peruvian American. 

The terminology used to describe people from specific ethnic and racial groups continues to change over time and preferences can vary from person to person.  Refer to the “Terms for specific groups” section of the [American Psychological Association’s style guide for Racial and Ethnic Identity](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/racial-ethnic-minorities) for specific guidance. 

### Disabilities

According to the Centers for Disease Control, a disability is “any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions).”  The members of some disability communities may have certain preferences about identity and naming than others (e.g. person-first or identity-first). Ask the subjects and communities about their preferences to ensure they are respectfully and accurately described. 

Just like when describing other types of communities, in **person-first language**, the individual, rather than their condition is emphasized (e.g. “a woman with epilepsy”, rather than “an epileptic”).  **Identity-first language**, on the other hand, focuses on the disability and is often used to express pride in, and reclaim a term that may have been used or seen negatively in the past.   

Both person- and identity- first approaches to language may be used to respect disabled persons.  According to the APA,

>Mixing this language may help you avoid cumbersome repetition of “person with . . .” and is also a means to change how authors and readers regard disability and people within particular disability communities. Indeed, the level of disability identity integration can be an effective way to decipher the language that is preferred by the persons about whom you are writing.[^10]

If describing an individual, use the language they use to describe themselves; ask them directly about their preferences, if possible; or seek guidance from advocacy groups or other groups representing their particular community. 

Avoid euphemisms that are condescending such as “special needs,” “handi-capable,” and “differently abled.”  Additionally, emphasize abilities, rather than limitations (e.g. “person who uses a wheelchair” rather than “wheelchair bound”).  Use neutral language instead of terms that are negative or suggest a lack (e.g. “person who had a stroke” rather than “stroke victim”).  Legacy language used to describe disabilities has often been offensive, discriminatory, and marginalizing. The [Stanford Disability Language Guide](https://disability.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26391/files/media/file/disability-language-guide-stanford_1.pdf) has a useful table of legacy terms and preferred language.
