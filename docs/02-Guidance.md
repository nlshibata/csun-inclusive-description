### 2. General Guidance
#### Creator-sourced/transcribed description
When transcribing directly from a source, indicate this in the record and provide context, if needed. According to the *Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia’s Anti-Racist Description Resources*,

> Consider your audience and the potential for harm when making
> decisions about whether to preserve problematic creator-supplied
> language. In most cases, preserve but contextualize creator-sourced
> original description when racism is an important context for
> understanding records. If you choose to maintain some or all racist
> creator-based description, draw a distinction between the
> creator-supplied description and archivist-supplied description…[^1]

While they speak specifically to racist content, this guidance is useful when working with any challenging creator-sourced content.
