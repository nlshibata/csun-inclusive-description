## 4. Digital collections guidelines

### Content warnings and disclaimers

Content warnings should be added both to the collection description on the digital collection’s landing page as well as in the item record(s) that contain challenging material.  Be specific about the nature of the content.   

**Landing page warnings** appear at the top of the “About” section on the landing page in italics (e.g. Warning: This collection contains graphic images depicting partial nudity and corporal punishment.)  

**Item record warnings** appear in the Title element of the record in brackets ahead of the actual title description (e.g. [Warning: corporal punishment] Imprisoned people in cangues, ca. 1910).  Titles appear prominently in search results and when browsing the collection assets, alerting users to the nature of the content.   

Below is a list of common topics you might flag.  It is not exhaustive, and when writing a warning or disclaimer, feel free to use even more specific terminology to describe the content: 

- Abuse 
- Ableism 
- Ageism 
- Animal cruelty or animal death 
- Blood 
- Child abuse/pedophilia/incest 
- Classism or elitism 
- Death or dying 
- Eating disorders, body hatred, body dysmorphia, and fatphobia 
- Hateful language 
- Homophobia, queerphobia, or heterosexism 
- Immigration, refugee, or border-crossing narratives 
- Kidnapping and abduction 
- Mental health struggles and mental illness 
- Miscarriages, abortions, or childbirth 
- Pornographic content 
- Poverty, homelessness, or financial struggle 
- Racism and/or racial slurs 
- Religious persecution (e.g., Islamophobia, anti-Semitism) 
- Self-harm, suicide, or suicidal ideation 
- Sexism and/or misogyny 
- Sexual assault or rape 
- Torture or cruelty 
- Transphobia or transmisogyny 
- Violence 
- War

### Subject headings

- Assign 3-5 subject headings per resource 
- Use simple headings, rather than multi-term complex subject headings.  Complex headings are often difficult to understand and search.  Additionally, they are often too unique to be helpful with collocation. 
- Alternate, non-LCSH vocabularies may be used when an LC term is outdated, harmful, or when a subject is not adequately represented in LCSH. See [Appendix I](/csun-inclusive-description/docs/01-Appendix)
- For personal or corporate names that are not included in the LC Name Authority File, check Wikidata and local resources like historical newspapers for authority information.
